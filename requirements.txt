Requirements for Building a Web-Based Snake Game 🐍🎮

To create a Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Canvas), here’s what you’ll need:

1️⃣ Tech Stack

✅ HTML → To create the game canvas and UI buttons.
✅ CSS → To style the game area, buttons, and snake appearance.
✅ JavaScript (with Canvas API) → For game logic, snake movement, food spawning, and collision detection.

2️⃣ Functional Requirements

🔹 Start Button → Begins the game when clicked.
🔹 Snake Movement → Moves using Arrow Keys (⬅️⬆️⬇️➡️).
🔹 Food Generation → Spawns randomly inside the grid.
🔹 Score System → Increases when the snake eats food.
🔹 Collision Detection → Ends the game if the snake hits itself or the walls.
🔹 Restart Game → Auto-restarts after Game Over.
🔹 Pause/Resume Button → Stop and resume gameplay anytime.
🔹 Snake Reaches Full Edge of the Grid (No premature stop!)

3️⃣ Design Requirements

🎨 Snake → A moving green block representing the snake.
🎨 Food → A small red square that spawns randomly.

4️⃣ Tools Required

5️⃣ Optional Features for Future Updates
