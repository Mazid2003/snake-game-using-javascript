**🚀 How the Game Works?**

1️⃣ The snake is represented by div elements inside a CSS grid-based game board (No canvas used).<br>
2️⃣ The player moves the snake using the Arrow Keys.<br>
3️⃣ The snake moves to the exact border before stopping, no early cut-off.<br>
4️⃣ The food appears randomly, and when eaten, the snake grows, and the score increases.<br>
5️⃣ The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the edges of the box.<br>
6️⃣ Click "Start Game" to begin, and click "Pause" to stop & resume anytime.<br>

**🚀 Future Improvements**

🔹 More Levels & Obstacles (Walls or AI-controlled enemies)<br>
🔹 Mobile Swipe Controls (Swipe left/right/up/down to control the snake 📱)<br>
🔹 Leaderboard System (Save best scores)<br>
🔹 Speed Increase Over Time (To make it more challenging)<br>
🔹 Sound Effects (For eating food & crashing)<br>
